<h1 align="center">Sports News and Information App</h1>

Developed an Android App focused on Sports News and Information.  The app will allow users to explore various sports categories, news, athletes, events, and historical archives using Google Material components such as TabLayout, ViewPager2, and BottomNavigation.  Each Fragment will include a dynamic RecyclerView which enables users to add new elements through the floatingActionButton Add(+).
